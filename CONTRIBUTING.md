# How to contribute

Issues, whether bugs, tasks, or feature requests are essential for keeping Cuddlefish (and Fairwinds in general) great. We believe it should be as easy as possible to contribute changes that
get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we
need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on
top of things.

## Getting Started

* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * Apply the appropriate labels, whether it is bug, feature, or task.

## Making Changes

* Create a feature branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is usually the master branch.
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master; `git checkout -b
    feature master`. Please avoid working directly on the
    `master` branch.
  * See [Development](/docs/development.md) for strategies for working on this project
* Try to make commits of logical units of work.
* Where possible make sure you have added the necessary tests for your changes.
* Make sure you have added any required documentation changes.
* Submit a pull request.
* Add anyone involved as a reviewer.

## TargetProcess

You can link a pull request or branch to a TargetProcess card. See the relevant sections in the [targetprocess docs](https://www.targetprocess.com/guide/integrations/devops-integrations/devops-integrations-2/)
